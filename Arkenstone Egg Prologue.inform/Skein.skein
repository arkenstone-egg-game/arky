Deep in the heart of the Lonely Mountain there was a tomb. Not a nasty, dirty wet tomb, filled with ooze and the ends of worms, nor yet a sterile, gloomy tomb with nothing to look at or admire; it was a dwarven tomb, and that means magnificence.

Great Chamber of Thror
High above, a small opening of some sort provides a glimmer of light and a faint breeze from outside. The walls of the great chamber are out of the light's reach, though. A few overturned tables and a broken lantern are all that can be seen.

You can see a lantern here.

Great Chamber of Thror
This enormous chamber is filled with activity as dozens of dwarves work to restore it to its former glory. Dust and cobwebs are being cleared away, the conference tables repaired, hearths rekindled, and broken carvings either smoothed and polished again or replaced with new ones. Dwarves on high ladders are even re-opening the skylights, allowing more fresh air and sunlight to fill the room. In the new light, you see a pair of majestic doors leading east towards the sound of rushing water, as well as an archway with stairs leading deep down towards the heart of the Lonely Mountain, as well as another pair of gilded doors to the south.

Deep in the heart of the Lonely Mountain there was a tomb. Not a nasty, dirty wet tomb, filled with ooze and the ends of worms, nor yet a sterile, gloomy tomb with nothing to look at or admire; it was a dwarven tomb, and that means magnificence.

It was a gleaming stone mausoleum carved with silver-flecked granite statues of noble dwarves, surrounded by sturdy yet elegant benches, playful fountains and pools catching the light from gem-like windows high overhead; all emanating a sense of peace and welcome.

Winding Stairs
The stairs are very steep and wind down around a central pillar for what seems like an eternity. Stairwells and doorways often appear on the landings, but they are all blocked by old rubble or barricades. Eventually the final stairwell appears. Great dwaven statues loom over several doorways, all of them open, but only the one to the north has been unblocked.

Long Hallway
This hallway is brightly lit, causing the gilded carvings on either side to glimmer magnificently. They are seperated into 4 different scenes, including one on the south end that seem unfinished. The south end goes through a doorway and turns into stairs leading up. The north end opens onto a wide cavern.

You can now see the Great Hall in full.

Great Hall of Thror
This enormous chamber is filled with activity as dozens of dwarves work to restore it to its former glory. Dust and cobwebs are being cleared away, the conference tables repaired, hearths rekindled, and broken carvings either smoothed and plished again or replaced with new ones. Dwarves on high ladders are even re-opening the skylights, allowing more fresh air and sunlight to fill the room. In the new light, you see a pair of majestic doors leading east towards the sound of rushing water, as well as an archway with stairs leading deep down towards the heart of the Lonely Mountain.

It was a gleaming stone mausoleum carved with silver-flecked granite statues of noble dwarves, surrounded by sturdy yet elegant benches, playful fountains and pools catching the light from gem-like windows high overhead; all emanating a sense of peace and welcome.

Great Hall of Thror
High above, a small opening of some sort provides a glimmer of light and a faint breeze from outside. The walls of the great chamber are out of the light's reach, though. A few overturned tables and a broken lantern are all that can be seen.

You can see a lantern here.

Deep in the heart of the Lonely Mountain there was a tomb. Not a nasty, dirty wet tomb, filled with ooze and the ends of worms, nor yet a sterile, gloomy tomb with nothing to look at or admire; it was a dwarven tomb, and that means magnificence.
